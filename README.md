# datluj

This simple and stupid cli tool to simulate dumbphone keyborad typing.

I wrote this tool long time ago and find fun to get it to compile on today's
linux machine (originally written uder some version of dos :-). So it will work
only on posix system. Nothing more, the code is hardly optimal anyway.
